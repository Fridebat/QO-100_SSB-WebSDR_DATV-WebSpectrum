 * downmixer.c
 * ===========
 * the downmixer works like a real anaog mixer, it shifts the frequency down by some amount.
 * 
 * Example:
 * The input signal is 1 MHz,
 * the LO frequency is 900 kHz
 * the output of the down mixer is the input signal shifted
 * down to 1MHz-900kHz = 100 kHz
 * 
 * this function is mainly used to shift a signal down to the baseband (0 Hz) 
 * for SSB demodulation.
 * 
 * Functional blocks:
 * 1) NCO ... digital oscillator, made with a simulated DDS Synthesizer
 *    and a sine wave lookup table.
 * 2) Multiplier ... mixing is done by multiplication of the input signal
 *    with the LO frequency (the NCO output)
 * 3) low pass filter ... pass only the wanted frequencies are passed
 * 
 * NCO ... theory of operation
 * ==========================
 * 
 * NCO's reference clock:
 * ----------------------
 * In an SDR we already have a sampling frequency generated by the receiver/soundcard.
 * We use this also as the reference clock for the NCO, which means that we increment
 * the NCO's accumulator with every sample.
 * 
 * Increment:
 * ----------
 * the increment (FSW) defines the out frequency of the NCO:
 * Fout = FSW * Fclk / 2^N
 * i.e.:
 * N = 32 bit (the accumulator has 32 bits)
 * Fclk = 2,4MHz (the SDRs sampling rate is 2.4 Msamples/s)
 * FSW = i.e. 1e9 (frequency control word to the the wanted output frequency)
 * 
 * Fout = 1e9 * 2.4e6 / (2^32) = 558 794 Hz
 * 
 * the other way round: which FSW do we need for a given output frequency ?
 * FCW = Fout * 2^N / Fclk
 * FCW = 558 794 * 2^32 / 2.4e6 = 1e9
 * (this is the formular we need to the the mixer LO frequency)
 * 
 * sine wave lookup table:
 * -----------------------
 * we do not need all 32 bits from the accumulator because the lookup table would be
 * much too long. Instead we throw away the lower 16 bits and just use the upper 16
 * bits. A 16 bit table gives a good SNR, much better than only 8 bits.
 * 
 * multiplier:
 * -----------
 * this is a simple multiplication ob the samples and the LO
 * 
 * low pass filter:
 * ----------------
 * is required to remove the mirror. The filter must be broad enough for the wanted frequencies, i.e.
 * 4 kHz for voice
